# python resizeAndAddLogo.py

# At a high level, hereâ€™s what the program should do:
# Load the logo image.
# Loop over all .png and.jpg files in the working directory.
# Check whether the image is wider or taller than 300 pixels.
# If so, reduce the width or height (whichever is larger) to 300 pixels and scale down the other dimension proportionally.
# Paste the logo image into the corner.
# Save the altered images to another folder.

# This means the code will need to do the following:
# Open the catlogo.png file as an Image object.
# Loop over the strings returned from os.listdir('.').
# Get the width and height of the image from the size attribute.
# Calculate the new width and height of the resized image.
# Call the resize() method to resize the image.
# Call the paste() method to paste the logo.
# Call the save() method to save the changes, using the original filename.

 # in a 300x300 square, and adds catlogo.png to the lower-right corner.
